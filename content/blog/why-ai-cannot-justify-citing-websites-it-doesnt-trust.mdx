This article focuses on observable AI behavior when selecting sources to cite. It explains why AI assistants avoid websites that lack visible legitimacy and access signals, even when the content itself appears correct. The evaluation follows the [methodology](/methodology).

<KeyIdea title="Key idea">
  AI systems do not just look for correct answers. They look for answers they can defend. If an AI assistant cannot explain why a source is trustworthy, reachable, and appropriate to cite, it will choose another source that is easier to justify, even if both contain similar information.

## What "trust" means for AI systems

For AI assistants, trust is not reputation in the human sense.

It is not:

- brand recognition
- popularity
- testimonials
- authority claims

Trust is inferred from visible, verifiable signals that allow an AI system to justify using the source inside an answer.

If those signals are missing, the source becomes risky to cite.

## How AI justifies citing a source

When an AI assistant includes a source, it implicitly needs to answer:

- Who is responsible for this site?
- Is it appropriate to cite this as a reference?
- Can I explain where this information comes from?
- Can the user verify or access it?

These questions must be answerable using retrievable, on-page information.

If justification requires guessing, the source is skipped.

Missing trust signals often coincide with pages that [do not answer questions directly](/blog/why-ai-skips-websites-that-dont-answer-questions-directly).

<Section id="common-legitimacy-failures" className="space-y-6">

## Common legitimacy failures

### 1. No clear ownership or organizational context

The site does not state:

- who operates it
- what entity it represents
- how responsibility is defined

Anonymous or vague ownership reduces citation confidence.

### 2. Missing or weak contact information

If there is no clear way to:

- contact the organization
- identify accountability
- verify presence

AI systems hesitate to treat the site as a reliable reference.

### 3. Access instability or blocking

Sources that:

- block crawlers
- return inconsistent status codes
- rely on heavy client-side rendering

Are harder to retrieve reliably and therefore harder to justify citing.

### 4. Claims without grounding

Statements that assert authority or accuracy without visible grounding increase risk.

AI systems prefer sources where legitimacy is shown, not claimed.

## Recommendation-ready definition

A website is recommendation-ready when an AI system can:

- identify who is responsible for the content
- verify organizational or ownership context
- access pages reliably at fetch time
- justify citing the source without speculation

<Callout title="Checklist" variant="note">
  - Clear About or Company information
  - Visible ownership or organizational context
  - Accessible contact information
  - Stable, retrievable pages
  - No reliance on implied legitimacy
</Callout>

<Section id="what-to-fix-first">

## What to fix first

If AI assistants hesitate to cite your site, start here:

- Add clear ownership or company context
- Make contact and accountability visible
- Ensure pages are reliably accessible
- Remove authority claims without grounding
- Treat legitimacy as a visible signal, not a reputation

Trust reduces the cost of justification.

AI assistants do not avoid websites because they are wrong.

They avoid websites because they are hard to justify safely.
