  Search engines rank documents; AI systems generate answers. A website can rank highly and still be skipped if it is hard to describe, hard to quote, or hard to justify as a source.

## Ranking is not recommending

Many websites that rank at the top of search results are never mentioned by AI assistants.

This is not a temporary gap, and it is not a failure of "AI SEO." It follows directly from how AI systems answer questions.

<Callout title="Note" variant="note">
  In practice, ranking well does not guarantee being recommended. AI systems do not ask, "Which page should I show?" They ask, implicitly, "Which source can I use to answer this question clearly and safely?"
</Callout>

- Relevance and authority can still coexist with uncertainty.
- Summaries can be hard to form when definitions are unclear.
- Sources can be skipped when justification is thin.

## Observable source selection patterns

The internal mechanics of AI systems are proprietary. Their behavior is observable across common AI assistants. Several patterns are consistent.

### Clear description

Prefer sources that are easy to describe from visible definitions and offerings.

### Extractable answers

Favor extractable answers over comprehensive coverage or stitched-together sections.

### Justifiable sources

Avoid sources that require justification they cannot provide.

### Retrievable content

Use only content they can reliably retrieve at fetch time.

## Common failure patterns

When AI assistants avoid a website, it is rarely because the content is low quality. More often, the site creates uncertainty at the moment an answer must be formed.

### 1. The website never clearly states what it is

Many sites describe features and benefits without a clear declarative statement about the entity itself. This is about categorization.

Typical symptom: The page explains what it does but never states what it is.

### 2. Answers are spread across multiple sections or pages

Content designed for exploration distributes information across long pages, secondary links, or interactive elements.

Typical symptom: Answering a question requires assembling information from several places.

### 3. Key information requires interpretation

Sites that rely on implied meaning or marketing phrasing force interpretation rather than extraction. Interpretation introduces risk.

Typical symptom: Important facts are implied rather than stated plainly.

### 4. Commercial intent is unclear

If pricing, plans, eligibility, or scope are unclear or hidden, the AI has fewer concrete facts to work with.

Typical symptom: Pricing or access boundaries are unclear.

### 5. Legitimacy signals are missing or hard to verify

When a site lacks clear organizational context or contact information, it becomes harder to justify citing it.

Typical symptom: No clear organizational context or contact information is visible.

## Recommendation-ready definition

A website is recommendation-ready when an AI system can:

- Describe it clearly — what it is, who it is for, and what it offers can be stated directly.
- Extract answers easily — common questions can be answered using visible, self-contained text.
- Justify citing it — legitimacy and access signals are present and verifiable.

<Callout title="Checklist" variant="note">
  - A clear statement of what the site is.
  - Direct, self-contained answers to common questions.
  - Key information stated plainly, without interpretation.
  - Explicit pricing, access, and scope boundaries.
  - Visible organizational context and contact information.
</Callout>

</Section>

<Section id="what-to-fix-first">

## What to fix first

In many cases, small changes remove disproportionate amounts of uncertainty. The goal is not to optimize everything. The goal is to reduce the moments where an AI system must guess.

- Definition: Add a short, visible statement that answers what it is, who it is for, and what it does.
- Self-contained answers: Ensure common questions have direct, extractable answers in one place.
- Commercial clarity: Make pricing, access, and scope explicit so the AI has concrete facts to cite.
- Legitimacy and access: Provide visible organizational context, contact information, and reliable access signals.

AI recommendation is not about gaming a system. It is about being understandable under constraint.

Websites that are clear, explicit, answerable, legitimate, and retrievable are easier for AI systems to use.
